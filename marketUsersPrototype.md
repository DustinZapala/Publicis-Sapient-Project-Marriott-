## Understand Your Users
The user research indicates strong correlations between the qualitative insights from the compilation video and the quantitative data from the survey results. For example, the first user interviewed, a 40-year-old father of two seeking a unique vacation experience for his family, resonated with the 27.44% of surveyed Marriott Bonvoy members who sought inspiration for their next trip. Similarly, the second user, a 29-year-old planning a beach trip with friends, mirrored the 38.67% majority who knew the type of vacation they desired but hadn't finalized a destination. As users engaged with the Marriott website, notable pain points emerged. The first user, grappling with indecision, found the interactive map cumbersome, displaying an overwhelming array of locations and failing to provide a clear view of desired destinations, such as Copake, New York. Meanwhile, the second user encountered usability challenges, including the absence of intuitive dropdown menus and cumbersome navigation through destination options, such as the "Popular Destinations" card section on the homepage. These insights underscore the importance of user-centric design and streamlined navigation for Marriott's digital platform, as users ultimately seek an experience that effortlessly aligns with their preferences and facilitates informed decision-making.
